## v2 comments
While the first version is simple and clean, it was not satisfying to look at from my point of view, the journey of updating the animations started with me attempting to add a pseudo element to the input element for 10-15 minutes before searching up why it did't appear to be rendered. The answer was simple, only elements with a container can render pseudo elements, which a input element did not. What to do then? HAXs! Woohoo! It started pretty simple and straight forward, i knew what kind of effect I wanted, and I knew how to make it happen. I wanted the black bottom border to be colored from the left to right instead of coloring the whole thing right away as it normally does. The result is just as I imagined, A result I could proudly say that I made it, and maybe even something I can implement into future projects. The button in v2 may not look as fancy as in v1, but I just wanted to apply the same effect to the button to, for better visualization of how the coloring is done.

# General
While the effect is easy to make, yet powerful, this little project was more like a task that was done to refresh my CSS skills. Because of school, I had little to no time to play around with CSS, and had not done anything in quite some time. This little project was enough to light my flames again and is the reason why i chose to save here for later use when I start to work again.
