# General

While the effect is easy to make, yet powerful, this little project was more like a task that was done to refresh my CSS skills. Because of school, I had little to no time to play around with CSS, and had not done anything in quite some time. This little project was enough to light my flames again and is the reason why i chose to save here for later use when I start to work again.
