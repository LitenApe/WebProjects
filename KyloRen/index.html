        <h1>Ben Solo</h1>
        <p>Ben Solo, the man who would become Kylo Ren,
          was born in Hanna City, Chandrila a year after the Battle of Endor,
          in which his parents, Princess Leia Organa and General Han Solo,
          led the Alliance to Restore the Republic in a decisive victory over the Galactic Empire.
          Their victory resulted in the deaths of the Emperor, Darth Sidious,
          and Organa's biological father, the Sith Lord Darth Vader.
          Ben Solo's namesake was that of the late Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi,
          who went by the name of Ben Kenobi while in exile on Tatooine after the fall of the Jedi Order.
          In his youth, Ben's parents had active lives in their respective professions.
          Han Solo, a smuggler before joining the Rebellion, was unable to stay in one place for long.
          Organa, meanwhile, became a respected senator in the New Republic,
          the government that arose after the Battle of Endor and that had served the Empire a final defeat during the Battle of Jakku around the time of Ben's birth.
          Organa and Solo's natures clashed, and their busy lives left Ben with feelings of abandonment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Ben proved to be Force-sensitive, taking after his mother,
          as well as his grandfather. Growing up,
          Ben was unaware of his true lineage—that he was the grandson of Darth Vader.
          Only his parents and Organa's twin brother, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker,
          knew the truth of Anakin Skywalker's past.
          Organa decided to keep the truth from Ben but planned on telling him when he was older,
          though by the age of twenty-three he still did not know his grandfather's real identity.
          She nonetheless hoped that she could tell her son the truth,
          and that Skywalker could explain that, in the end,
          Vader was redeemed and that the light inside of Anakin Skywalker had returned.
          By the same age, Ben had begun training with Skywalker as one of the students in his uncle's new generation of Jedi,
          which the Jedi Master was training in the hopes of restoring the Jedi Order.
          Organa recognized similarities between Ben and Darth Vader and hoped that Skywalker's training could help her son.

          Twenty-four years after the Battle of Endor,
          the Inner Rim planet of Birren, settled by explorers from Alderaan and Arkanis,
          suffered the death of its ruling monarch, Lord Mellowyn.
          His closest living relative was Senator Organa,
          but she was not interested in its governorship—nor did she believe that Ben would be interested in succeeding her one day.
          The title passed to Lady Carise Sindian.
          Shortly thereafter, the truth about Organa's parentage was revealed by her political enemies,
          including Lady Sindian, in the Galactic Senate.
          Organa had yet to tell her son about Darth Vader, and she worried about how he would react after finding out about it in such a public way.
        </p>
        <br>

          Ben ultimately betrayed his uncle and embraced the dark side of the Force.
          He destroyed everything that Skywalker tried to build, leaving his Jedi Temple in ashes.
          Ben Solo took on the name Kylo Ren, becoming an apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke and a member of the Knights of Ren.
          He was trained by the Supreme Leader, and that training helped make Ben nothing more than a distant memory in the life of Kylo Ren.
          In time, he was the most gifted apprentice of the Supreme Leader and the embodiment of a new generation of dark side warriors that emerged to fill the void left by the fall of the Sith.
