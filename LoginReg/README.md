# logReg
logReg is a simple log inn screen that looks ok while testing out the css blur and rotate property

# Why did I make this?
The main reason for making this page was to deep diver into css and it's possibilities. I wanted to test out the blur and flipping properties of CSS and explore how I could use it to hide/display information without adding/removing elements.

# Note to the creator!
Add thickness to the card when you have the time. Making it look alot more realistic and awesome!
