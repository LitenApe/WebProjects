# logReg
logReg is a simple log inn screen that looks aestically decent while testing out the css blur and rotate property

# Why did I make this?
The main reason for making something so simple as this is beacause i wanted to play around with the blur and flipping properties in CSS.

Add thickness to the card when you have the time. Making it look alot more realistic and awesome!
