# Countdown Clock
This is a simple javascript countdown clock concept launch page that i made as a teaser for a friends up and coming app. Almost none of the javascript code is written by me, and all credit for the working clock goes to [Yaphi Berhanu](http://www.sitepoint.com/build-javascript-countdown-timer-no-dependencies/)

# Why did I make this?
This is one of my first introductions with javasctipt, so i created this countdown clock to get a better understanding of how javascript and html interacts with each other
