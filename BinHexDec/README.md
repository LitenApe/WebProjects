# Binary - Hexadecimal - Decimal (March 2017)
This is a converter i made with vuejs. I wanted a much more responsiv converter then what i found on the Internett. Why you ask? At the moment, i have a course named computer network were i work with bits all the time. I dont know why, but i cant count binary quickly, and instead of wasting alot of time to count and convert bits to hexadecimal or decimal, i created this to help me out. It may not seem like much, and you are completely right, it does not do much, but it does ONE thing. And that one thing is the only thing i want it to do. If you found this and tested it out, you may see that it sucks if you try to insert a negative number. That is mainly because i never work with negative binary, so i just dont see the reason why i should implement it.  

# Tools used
If you look at the html file, you may see that i am using bootstrap and vuejs. Now you are probably wondering, is this guy an idiot? Dragging in all that css and js for something he could have meed with vanilla javascript and vanilla css easily. Well, laziness hit me and i didnt want to write vanilla javascript. Just look at the [javascript file](https://litenape.github.io/BinHexDec/script.js). I would say that is almost readable compared to my other hexadecimal to rgb converting code. Ok, he is a lazy bastard and used vuejs because he didnt want to write alot of code, but why bootstrap? He got literaly no styling applied to his element, he didnt even need any! Yes, yes you are right, bootstrap is a complete overkill and is really a stupid thing to include in this small project. But i wanted the nice font that comes with bootstrap and i didnt want to use time on aligning the labels and input fields, it is a easy task, but it was done automatically for me by bootstrap. And it is 11pm, i dont want to do things like aligning text when all i really want is to be in bed under my comfy blanket.

tldr; I used vuejs and bootstrap
