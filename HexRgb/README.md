# HexadecimalRGB(August 2016)
This is a simple background colour changing web page which gives you a rgb code to any valid hex colour code and the other way around to.

# Why did I make this?
After an long break away from web development, I wanted to try something different from what i usually do, which is playing around in CSS. I wanted to create something that relied much more on javascript then CSS, which is why i decided to create this background colour changer. The biggest obstacle i encountered while creating this colour code converter was all the possible combinations of input it could receive. It would be to much work to create a gigantic array of data, so i had to rely on regex, which I had never used before. A lot of google searcing later, and there it is. A colour code converter that is able to convert rgb colour code to hex and the other way around to.
